# D&D Alerter - Web Interface

The web interface is used by a player to notify his team that he wants to say something!
The only information needed is the ID on the D&D Alerter itself (given by the player's team).

Good news: The interface is available for free here: [https://jnthbdn.github.io/DnD_Alerter/](https://jnthbdn.github.io/DnD_Alerter/)
